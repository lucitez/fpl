1. make graph look pretty
2. make graph dynamic -- show different stats
3. overlay graph? multiple stats per gameweek?
4. make home include search params
5. player comparison graph
6. How do we show undervalued players? points / price, ICT / points, ICT / price, etc.
7. chart tooltip should show value vs. team
8. click on gw for player to see breakdown (how did they reach X points?) <-- modal
9. maybe a second card next to the player summary that's a table of gw -> columns of stats
